Attendees: Effie, Camilla && Pia
Notes: Today we went through what we did on wednesday and thursday. 
*Effie-> was dying, but also Imported fonts, made the header module 
and made the footer module. Wasn't sure of implementation of grid for footer, 
put it in grid-rows(just for footer) but it works. 
*Camilla->made a search-function(module), and she has been bugfixing for Pia, 
also merging everybodys pull-requests.
*Pia->made author-list, launched on netlify, allowed cors-origin. 

Plans: 
*Effie: make figma for author, work on variables, 
*Camilla: add empty search function
*Pia: Minor bug-fix in author module, and add books(title)
**Together: Add variables, look at how to just get 
the search input out in html, and not all the booklists.
